  "description": "WebSkel is a minimal, JavaScript-based framework designed to facilitate the development of web applications using web components. It provides a set of utilities and services that assist developers in managing and controlling the behaviour of their applications. WebSkel implements the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern, enabling developers to create views as web components, presenters in JavaScript, and models as JavaScript objects. The presenter is responsible for populating the view with data from the models. ## Features",
